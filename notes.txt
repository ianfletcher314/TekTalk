this is a mockup of the website
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TGsnAtloezz-FkZ5VU7f3hynXpKMqQJmitAcSocmzng/edit#slide=id.gf645a61e47_0_7

List of Components:

1. Home
2. Individual Sound (SoundSingle.handlebars)
3. Samples Page (Samples.handlebars)
4. Drums (Drums.handlebars)
5. Noise (Noise.handlebars)
6. Loops (Loops.handlebars)
7. Contact
10. Profile 
11. New Sound
12. Dashboad (scrolling sounds for home page)
13 Tags (potentially searchable by genre tags)



To Do Next:

1) figure out routes 
2) finish creating home page from the PP mock up 
    (currently being built in dashboard component so it  can be put into home)
3) map out what I want  profile / dashboard to look like
4) map out what I want the single category page ie noise or drums too look like
