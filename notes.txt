this is a mockup of the website
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TGsnAtloezz-FkZ5VU7f3hynXpKMqQJmitAcSocmzng/edit#slide=id.gf645a61e47_0_7

List of Components:

1. Home
2. Individual Sound (SoundSingle.handlebars)
3. Samples Page (Samples.handlebars)
4. Drums (Drums.handlebars)
5. Noise (Noise.handlebars)
6. Loops (Loops.handlebars)
7. Contact
10. Profile 
11. New Sound
12. Dashboad (scrolling sounds for home page)
13 Tags (potentially searchable by genre tags)



To Do Next:

1) figure out routes 
2) finish creating home page from the PP mock up 
    (currently being built in dashboard component so it  can be put into home)
3) map out what I want  profile / dashboard to look like
4) map out what I want the single category page ie noise or drums too look like
5)update CSS to only be in the views it needs to be in
6)create a single sound component and redesign the newpost component in slides
7)coninue adding to slides (new sound done)

Using the embeded spotify and apple music players could allow the user to input the song uri and click a toggle 
box that says spotify apple youtube tidal or whatever. once  the submit button is clicked the js would read the
button click status and if it was spotify It would create a spotify player with the inputed song as representation. 
this way a beat maker could have a variety of loops noise drums and samples in their respective libraries and they 
could be youtube spotify apple tidal or whatever else!
