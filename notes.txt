this is a mockup of the website
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TGsnAtloezz-FkZ5VU7f3hynXpKMqQJmitAcSocmzng/edit#slide=id.gf645a61e47_0_7

List of Components:

1. Home
2. Individual Sound (PostMain.handlebars)
3. Samples Page (Samples.handlebars)
4. Drums (Drums.handlebars)
5. Noise (Noise.handlebars)
6. Loops (Loops.handlebars)
7. Contact
10. Profile 
11. New Sound
12. Dashboad (scrolling sounds for home page)
13 Tags (potentially searchable by genre tags)



To Do Next:

1) figure out routes 
2) finish creating home page from the PP mock up 
    (need to do dashboard / render the actual posts and coments on the home page)
3)update CSS to only be in the views it needs to be in
4)coninue adding to slides (new sound/home/dash/login/SoundGroupGeneral/individual sound done)
5)figure out how to have multiple comments / posts load into a scrollable div
6) link up posts to the home page rather than placeholder songs 
7) design the post partial to look good so each song on the home page looks good 
8) figure out how to do a post text to player situation so the player isnt hard coded in
9) add input comment section to single post  and update slide

Using the embeded spotify and apple music players could allow the user to input the song uri and click a toggle 
box that says spotify apple youtube tidal or whatever. once  the submit button is clicked the js would read the
button click status and if it was spotify It would create a spotify player with the inputed song as representation. 
this way a beat maker could have a variety of loops noise drums and samples in their respective libraries and they 
could be youtube spotify apple tidal or whatever else!
